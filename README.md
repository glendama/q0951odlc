Light curves of the doubly imaged gravitationally lensed quasar FBQ 0951+2635 and Python scripts to create/display observed difference light curves (ODLCs)

q0951LT_USNO_DES_PS_2008_2023.dat: GLENDAMA+ brightness records of FBQ 0951+2635 (2025A&A...694A..315) until 1 December 2023, which were complemented with 
magnitudes at the two additional epochs MJD = 58925.941 and 60266.264. These records mainly consist of r-band magnitudes provided by observations with the 
Liverpool Telescope (GLENDAMA project; 2018A&A...616A.118G) and the Kaj Strand Telescope (2023ApJ...952...54R), and cover a period of 16 years in the last 
two decades (2008âˆ’2023).

q0951_ODLCs.py: Simple Python scripts to show the light curves of the two quasar images (q0951_LCs.png), and generate/show ODLCs (q0951_ODLC1.dat, 
q0951_ODLC2.dat and q0951_ODLCs.png).
